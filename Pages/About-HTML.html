            <p class="language-text">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
                designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is
                often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
                originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img&gt;
            and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;
            surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
            display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
        <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged
            the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to
            display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.</p>
