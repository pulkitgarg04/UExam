            <h3 class="language-heading">JavaScript</h3>
            <p class="language-text">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the
                core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
                JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
                web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a
                high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
                dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>SIt is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
            application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
            structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
        <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 98% of all websites (midâ€“2022)
            using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the
            DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.
        </p>
        <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
        <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and
            a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
        <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
            languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
